## Step-by-step walkthrough

##### 1. Create a project

##### 2. Download necessary assets
The assets can be found at this [link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://connect-prd-cdn.unity.com/20210507/bfd26de3-a68a-4a16-8cf6-8eacf2bb7f75/Prototype%25202%2520-%2520Starter%2520Files.zip&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674689684407550&usg=AOvVaw0VZNngPeWbs-agllbPkoWu)
Once the files have been downloaded, extract them from their folder.

##### 3. Move the assets into your project
Drag the unzipped folder titled ```prototype``` into the assets box in the Unity editor. You should see the folder you downloaded pop up in the assets box in the Unity editor.

Open the folder that was just created in the assets area of the Unity editor. Find the unity file and double click it. You will be presented with a screen that looks like this. Press import.

##### 6. Add characters
Go to the course library folder in the assets area of the Unity editor. Drag some characters into the scene. I've put a human (which we'll make our character that we're controlling) and three animals.
