Unity hub is an application that manages several softwares that are used to make games. It is used to download and install the unity editor, which is the main software used to make games. It also provides functionality to manage your projects.

After the file has finished downloading, open it. It may ask for permission to modify files on your computer. Say yes. After this, you should be greeted with a screen that looks like this:

Agree to the agreement, then press install. Depending on your computer, this may take a moment.

After it has finished installing, you will see this screen:

If you do see this screen, just press allow access to move on. If you left the ```launch unity hub``` box checked, Unity Hub will launch. If you didn't leave that box checked, open Unity Hub like you would any other program.
After opening Unity Hub, you will be prompted to install the unity editor. You may be present with a screen with several checkboxes on it. On that screen, ensure that microsoft visual studio is checked. Press install and wait for the install to finish.

If you left visual studio checked, you will be prompted to install the visual studio installer after the Unity editor is finished installing. Press continue and wait for the install to finish. If you unchecked visual studio, follow [these instructions](/guides/download-guides/vs-download) to install visual studio seperately.

After the Visual Studio installer is finished installing, select these three options:
