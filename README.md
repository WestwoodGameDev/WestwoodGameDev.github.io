# How to update the website (ask me if you want edit perms)
1. [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. open the ```/theme``` folder
3. open the ```/src``` folder
4. open the ```/pages``` folder
5. look at other pages in the subfolder you want your page in to learn how to create a page then create either a .astro or .mdx file depending on how fancy you need your page to be. (make sure to copy over the blips of code at the top of all the files in yourr chosen sub folder). if you plan on creating a new subfolder ask me.
6. if you want to style it up i recommend using ```<style>``` tags
7. if you want images use the ```<img href="relative image url" />``` if the page being adited is a .astro or .mdx (you can also use ```![image alt text](relative image url)``` in .mdx)
8. lastly unless you made you page a .mdx in the ```/lessons``` folder then you're going to want to link it in somewhere else in the website so that it is actually accessible.
9. if you have any other questions ask our resident web dev expert Yogansh aka Xxx_sharpkiller_xxX
